Design choice: A client is able to invite other logged in clients (who are not already in a conference session) to join the inviter's conference session 

Implementation: Create 3 new states INVITE, INVITE_ACK, INVITE_NACK. The inviter first send a INVITE request to the server, server NACK if the client the inviter invited is not logged in/ is in a session already. If the client could be invited, server then send a INVITE request to the client to be invited, the client can choose to ACK/NACK for willing to join/not join the session. 

Control packets:

type: INVITE , packet data: client ID
type: INV_ACK, packet data: N/A
type: INV_NACK, packet data: reason for failure
